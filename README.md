## about us

we are [Future Proof](https://futureproof.so)

our software empowers technologists of all kinds to build a better web

we've spent the past 2 years teaching people how to build and work in web3/blockchain/dweb

we helped over 30% of our community get paid $ roles in the space

we grew to 500+ members who are women, people of color, queer, trans, and non-binary folks

we learned that what the industry needs today is better tooling so more technologists can build

we believe a better web is possible
